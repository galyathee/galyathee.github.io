<h1>Programming with COBOL</h1>
<p>Without Cobol there would be no bank or insurance system (maybe ...)</p>
<p>My first tries with Cobol date 2001 in Paris. I received a several thousands of lines COBOL algorithm to rewrite in Borland C++. This were difficult, but magic.</p>
<p>Nowadays there persist a lot of systems running Cobol (despite the 2000's bug!)</p>

<div>So, before looking at a program example, here are some facts on Cobol</div>
<p></p>
<section style="border-style: dashed; border-width: 4px; border-color: teal; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; padding: 10px; ">
COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a programming language with a rich history and significance in the world of business and mainframe computing. Here are some key facts about COBOL:

    <p><b>It is designed for Business Applications:</b> COBOL was developed in the late 1950s by a committee of experts with the primary goal of creating a programming language for business data processing. It was intended to be easily readable and writable by business professionals.

    <p><b>It is the oldest High-Level Language:</b> COBOL is one of the oldest high-level programming languages that is still in use today. Its first version was released in 1959, making it over six decades old.

    <p><b>It was influenced by natural language:</b> COBOL syntax was influenced by natural languages like English, with a focus on readability and self-documenting code. This design choice aimed to bridge the gap between business requirements and programming.

    <p><b>It is a standard:</b> COBOL has undergone several standardization efforts over the years. The ANSI COBOL standard was established in 1968, and subsequent revisions have been made to modernize the language and improve its capabilities.

    <p><b>It dominates the mainframe software diversity:</b> COBOL became closely associated with mainframe computers, especially IBM mainframes. Many large organizations and financial institutions used COBOL extensively for their mission-critical systems.

    <p><b>It was concerned with the Y2K Bug:</b> Leading up to the year 2000, there was widespread concern about the "Y2K problem," where COBOL programs and other software might malfunction due to date-related issues. Extensive efforts were made to update and fix COBOL code to handle the transition to the new millennium.

    <p><b>It has strong resilience:</b> COBOL's longevity can be attributed to its resilience and ability to handle large volumes of data. Many legacy systems still rely on COBOL code for their core business operations.

    <p><b>COBOL Programmers are always looked for:</b> Despite its age, there is still demand for COBOL programmers, particularly to maintain and modernize existing systems. Some organizations struggle to find skilled COBOL developers.

    <p><b>A modernization in on the road:</b> Efforts have been made to modernize COBOL applications. This includes integrating COBOL with newer technologies, web services, and cloud platforms to extend the lifespan of legacy systems.

    <p><b>Symbol of legacy systems:</b> COBOL is often associated with "legacy systems," which are older computer systems and software that continue to be used because they are critical to an organization's operations.

    <p><b>COBOL invaded Government's softwares':</b> Many government agencies, particularly in the United States, still rely on COBOL-based systems for various functions, such as tax processing and social services.

    <p><b>COBOL has a verbose syntax:</b> COBOL is known for its verbose syntax, which includes divisions, sections, paragraphs, and sentences. It uses English-like statements to describe business logic.

    <p><b>COBOL knows several "dialects":</b> There are various dialects and versions of COBOL, including ANSI COBOL, Micro Focus COBOL, and IBM COBOL, each with its own extensions and features.

    <p>Overall, COBOL's enduring legacy in business and mainframe computing continues to be a testament to its significance in the history of programming languages.

    <p>Here I tested on <a href="https://onecompiler.com/cobol">https://onecompiler.com/cobol</a> a program I made to find the N first prime numbers</p>
    <p>The program is not exceptional : it adds '1' to any new tested number ... but hey, that's functioning :)</p>
    <p>That shows a bit what it can</p>
