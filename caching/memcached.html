<h1>Caching with MEMCACHED</h1>
<p>Caching is a critical component in system design. It plays a crucial role in optimizing systems for efficiency, reliability, and responsiveness. Especially in the so-called "serverless" architectures, we find ourselves with the need to persist information for a short time</p>
<p>Those situations are, among others:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Performance Improvement</b>: Caching significantly improves system performance by storing frequently accessed data in a fast and easily accessible location. This reduces the need to repeatedly fetch the same data from slower, more resource-intensive sources like databases or external APIs.</li>
    <li><b>Latency Reduction</b>: Cached data is typically stored in memory, which has much lower latency than disk or network access. This means that requests for cached data can be fulfilled more quickly, resulting in reduced response times for end-users.</li>
    <li><b>Scalability</b>: Caching can help distribute the load on backend services and databases. By reducing the number of requests to these resources, caching can prevent them from becoming bottlenecks, allowing the system to handle more concurrent users and requests.</li>
    <li><b>Cost Savings</b>: Caching can reduce the load on resource-intensive components, such as databases and external APIs. This can result in cost savings because it reduces the need to provision expensive hardware or pay for additional API usage.</li>
    <li><b>Redundancy and Fault Tolerance</b>: Caches can act as a redundancy layer, providing a copy of critical data in case the primary data source experiences downtime or failures. This helps ensure system availability and resilience.</li>
    <li><b>Better User Experience</b>: Faster response times and reduced latency lead to a better user experience. Applications that respond quickly are perceived as more responsive and user-friendly.</li>
    <li><b>Traffic Management</b>: Caching can be used to manage traffic spikes and reduce the impact of sudden surges in requests. It absorbs some of the load, preventing service disruptions during peak usage periods.</li>
    <li><b>Content Delivery</b>: Caches are commonly used in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to distribute content (e.g., images, videos, and web pages) closer to end-users, reducing latency and improving load times.</li>
    <li><b>Consistency Control</b>: Caching can be employed to manage data consistency in distributed systems. Techniques like caching with expiration and cache-invalidation strategies help ensure that cached data remains up to date.</li>
    <li><b>Data Transformation</b>: Caches can store preprocessed or transformed data, saving computational resources when generating complex or frequently used data structures.</li>
    <li><b>Rate Limiting and Security</b>: Caching can be used for rate limiting and security purposes. It can help protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by absorbing excess traffic and rate-limiting requests.</li>
    <li><b>Offline Access</b>: Caching can enable offline access to certain data or features by storing relevant content locally on user devices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Here are some glimpses of Memcached to illustrate its use</h2>

    <p><b>Installation</b> with Homebrew: <code>brew install memcached</code></p>
    <p>There are several packages in Python to manipulate Memcached, I ended up using pymemcache: <code>pip install pymemcache</code></p>
