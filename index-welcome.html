    <h1>Programming Things</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my page.</p>
    <p>On this website hosted by GitHub &#129505; I like to share on topics I particularly like</p>
    <p>Here is everything hand made. No complex framework. Pure HTML5 (see the canvas on the top ?!) & Javascript. I may introduce technologies (like JQuery) anytime if there is a strong need for that.</p>
    <p>Since the 50's, beginning with the assembly languages, Fortran (1957), List (1958), Cobol (1959), Algol 58 and Algol 60, more than 1000 programming were created.
        If we consider the <b>D</b>omain <b>S</b>pecific <b>L</b>anguages (SQL, HTML, Verilog, ...), certainly more than 10000.
        Every time, a specific need pushed people to create an interface to tell computers what to do.
        Nowadays, we write less and less. We talk with computers. More and more people having no idea of computer sciences can create web sites, push things into the Cloud, create animations, generate games for mobile phones.
        We entered the democratic era of the assisting services.
        All this is virtual, very often. Nonetheless it fascinates.
    </p>
    <p>Whatever the state of the Distributed Architectures, Cloud, Blockchain or Artificial Intelligence, there are gems or just cool things to know about that incredible world. This is where I want to begin.</p>
