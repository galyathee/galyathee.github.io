<h1>Notes on the future of computer sciences</h1>
<p>It is very difficult to predict the future : you need magical power, legal instruments and ingredients</p>
<p>HOWEVER it must be possible to see the trend</p>
<p>Let's consider first the past. In the past we had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframes</a> with terminals.
    We had also distributed operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_(operating_system)">AMOEBA</a></p>
<p>
    From the distributed systems we migrated to client computers.
</p>
<p>
    Today with the Cloud our smartphones look more and more like terminals.
</p>
<p>
    When I was 20 I dreamt from an information that chooses its path along the network.
    Instead of being routed through the network, that information was like a virus : it could transfer itself from one node to another, having access to the routing tables, deciding where to go.
    I believe that we will more and more build systems going in that direction. That seems contra-intuitive, but this is somehow what AIs will do : decide where to go.
</p>
<p>
    A note about containers. Well, I am not a prophet, I see containers growing since years. I tried Docker. I enjoyed also dealing with virtual machines.
    But I truly not believe that the future goes into that direction.
    I believe that containers are a transition between 2 revolutions. They are good enough to grow businesses and shift technologies.
    But they are missing something : the nature of our organizations. </p>
<p>
    Looking at social structures, there will be more and more big actors taking the whole market.
    Transposing Conway's law to social structures we should have more and more monolithic or "just big" systems.
    The current trend with microservices shows its end : it sucks, it generates too much costs, it is abused and its complexity reaches our brain limits (unless you accept to hire only PhD scientists)
</p>
<p>
    I believe in a future where the servers will be intelligent. The servers will guess what we want to do with these thousands files we are transferring without label.
    I believe that these AI will be the operating system : exposing the API, providing the security, analyzing the contents, improving the code, translating the news, etc...
</p>
<p>
    I read once that next AI will be able to re-program themselves ; to invent new languages and protocols that only their AI friend would understand.
    I read that AI will soon be like Einstein and we will play the idiots.
    I believe that this is only a control thing. As long as we do not give the keys of our national security to some AI, as long as we control the production and the production sites, as long as we keep a red button ready to stop everything, we should be safe.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever happens in this direction we have some more time. And maybe I will have the time to complete most of that website before this happens :)
